# Pay Tracker

Initially designed for Tesco employees on a Flexi contract, this software allows users to enter information about the shifts that they are working in a given pay period, and it will calculate the exact amount that they should be paid.
This includes dealing with the whole rigmaroul of 'when will I get paid for this overtime'.
Users can create an account, which is then used to log in and access information about their shifts.
It is also possible to calculate pay days retrospectively.
